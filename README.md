This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router v6. The problem arises from having a catch-all route (`/about/*`) that unintentionally overlaps with a more specific route (`/about`). This leads to the specific route being overshadowed and never being used, despite being defined correctly.  The solution provided removes the conflicting route and ensures correct routing behavior.
